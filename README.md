## Initializing your application

To keep secure the db connection i'm not commiting the database.yml,
instead there's an example of it.

To copy it just run:

```bash
  ./config/init.sh # this will copy the all .yml.example files to .yml
```

After that, you can change the necessary infos and start running the project
